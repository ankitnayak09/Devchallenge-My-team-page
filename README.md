## Overview

![screenshot](desktop-View.jpg)


Wooohoooooooooooo!! Did the second challenge . I must tell the it is best to learn web dev with projects rather than watching those tutorials. Keep on doing projects whether small or large. Keep Learning!
### Built With

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

It was a page which would be display whenever a page isn't available. It is now important to have your own designed page rather than the default 404 page.
