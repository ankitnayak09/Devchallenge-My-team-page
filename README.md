## Overview

![screenshot](Desktop-View.jpg)


I am a beginner in the field of web dev. So according to me the challenges nor too hard or too easy. It means with every project that you built. I would come over challenges and with them being solved i was learning a new thing.  
I got hands on flexbox also on responsive design using media query. 
I am looking forward to complete all of the challenges. They are fun to do.
### Built With

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

It was a page which would be display whenever a page isn't available. It is now important to have your own designed page rather than the default 404 page.
